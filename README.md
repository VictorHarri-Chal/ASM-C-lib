# ASM-C-lib

The purpose of this project was to make us discover assembly. The goal was to recode some of the commons functions from the C library and compile all of them into a dynamic shared library which can be used by anyone.

# Usage

``` make ```
- This project can't be directly tested ! But you can use the ASM functions in other projects.
